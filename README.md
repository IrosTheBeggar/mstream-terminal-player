# mstream-player

Terminal player and headless audio engine for [mStream](https://github.com/IrosTheBeggar/mStream).

**Status: Phase 3** — the playback engine (ported from mStream's `rust-server-audio`) streams
over HTTP with working range-request seeking, and there is now a full mStream API client with a
command-line front end. The interactive TUI lands in Phase 4. See [PLAN.md](PLAN.md) for the
roadmap and the control-API contract.

## Library commands

```
# log in once (password via env or stdin — only the token is stored)
echo "$PASSWORD" | mstream-player login --server http://localhost:3000 --user alice --password-stdin

mstream-player info                          # server capabilities + session
mstream-player ls "music/Artist/Album"       # browse folders
mstream-player browse "Artist" "Album"       # browse by tags
mstream-player search "moon"
mstream-player playlists [name]
mstream-player logout
```

Servers running in public mode (no users configured) need no login — just pass
`--server <url>`.

## Playback

```
mstream-player play "music/Artist/Album/01.flac" --seek-to 45   # via the saved session
mstream-player play "music/Artist/Album/01.flac" --transcode mp3 --bitrate 192k
mstream-player play --url C:\music\song.mp3                     # local file or raw URL
```

`play` is a one-shot smoke test with PASS/FAIL exit codes, useful for checking that a server,
codec, or seek path actually works. Transcoding accepts `mp3` or `aac`; the server's default
codec is often opus, which this player cannot decode, so a codec is always requested explicitly.

## Serve mode (jukebox engine)

```
mstream-player serve --port 3333
```

Drop-in successor to mStream's `rust-server-audio` — `mstream-player --port N` is accepted as a
legacy alias for the old spawn contract. Changes from the original engine:

- Binds `127.0.0.1` by default (`--host 0.0.0.0` restores the old LAN-exposed behavior)
- Optional auth: `--auth-token <t>` or env `MSTREAM_AUDIO_TOKEN` (checked as `x-auth-token`
  header on every route except `GET /version`)
- `GET /version` → `{"name", "version", "apiVersion"}`
- `--exit-with-parent`: exit when stdin closes (pass only when the parent holds stdin open)
- Bug fixes: volume persists across track changes, manual next is no longer trapped by
  loop-one, no panic when no audio device exists, removing a queue entry while stopped no
  longer starts playback

## Build

```
cargo build --release
```

Building on Linux needs ALSA headers (`libasound2-dev`); running needs `libasound`.

## License

GPL-3.0 — see [LICENSE](LICENSE). The engine originated in mStream as `rust-server-audio`.
